## Contributing to the repo
1. Create a new branch from "develop", and give it a useful name that indicates which feature (user story) you are implementing.
2. Write all the code and unit tests relating to that user story.  Commit each of your changes to your branch.
3. Create a Pull Request from your branch to "develop" (you can use the github GUI to do this).  Add two other team members to the Pull Request as "reviewers".
4. When the Pull Request is approved by other team members, merge it to "develop".
5. At the end of each sprint, we will merge "develop" into "master"
